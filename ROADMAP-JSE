# Planned features (in current priority order)

## Near future:
  * Full browser testing for the whole JavaScript test-suite with Chrome and Firefox
  * Support C++ implicit casting
  * Fully debug and include building w/o C++ exceptions to the unit-tested configurations
  * WASI/WASM/clang support

## Longer term:
  * Fully transparent for the user WASM async support without COOP/COEP (will be limited to 1 async operation at a time)
  * Modern testing harness for the JavaScript test-suite (chai?)
  * Transforming Javadoc/Oxygen to JSDoc support
  * Function arguments
  * Main-thread asynchronous I/O with `Asyncify`
  * Support calling asynchronous JavaScript callbacks from C++ with `Asyncify`
